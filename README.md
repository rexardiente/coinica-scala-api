### ![SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/assets/sbt-logo.svg) The Interactive Build Tool
  For Scala and Java - sbt is built for Scala and Java projects. It is the build tool of choice for 93.6% of the Scala developers (2019). One of the examples of Scala-specific feature is the ability to cross build your project against multiple Scala versions.

#### SBT Play Docker
- sbt stage
- sbt docker:stage
- sbt docker:publishLocal
- docker run -p 9000:9000 eos-game-store-api:1.0-SNAPSHOT

#### Set HTTP Idle Timeout
sbt runProd -Dplay.server.http.idleTimeout=180s

### Reminder:
> WebSocket protocol does not implement Same Origin Policy, and so does not protect against Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking. To secure a websocket against hijacking, the Origin header in the request must be checked against the serverâ€™s origin, and manual authentication (including CSRF tokens) should be implemented. If a WebSocket request does not pass the security checks, then acceptOrResult should reject the request by returning a Forbidden result.
