### Reminder:
> WebSocket protocol does not implement Same Origin Policy, and so does not protect against Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking. To secure a websocket against hijacking, the Origin header in the request must be checked against the serverâ€™s origin, and manual authentication (including CSRF tokens) should be implemented. If a WebSocket request does not pass the security checks, then acceptOrResult should reject the request by returning a Forbidden result.
